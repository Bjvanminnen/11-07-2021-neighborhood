What worked well with this project

- Velocity was constant in magnitude - we only had changes in direction
- Limited number of agents, where you could watch what each was doing, and
  to some extent understand (i.e. watching a pair of twirling circles get
  invaded)
- Non-linear behaviors - nearest neighbor can change, causing an agent to change
  their behavior
